Therefore, any rows containing missing value in 'review_score_rating' is dropped as well. This left us 2772 rows in df.

    "For data wrangling, 'date' column is the review data is converted to datetime object and a new column'month' is created to store the month extracted from 'date' column. For subsetted listing data df, 'cleaning fee' column is converted from currency to float number and all NAN values is filled with the average cleaning fee. As 'host_response_time' column stores string object, the missing values are filled with string 'not recorded'. For both 'host_response_rate' and 'host_acceptance_rate' column, values are converted from percentage to float first and NAN values are then filled with the mean value of each column. Moreover, dummy variables are created for categorical variable instant_bookable, host_identity_verified and hostres_time_clean for regression use. Lastly, original 'instant_bookable', 'host_identity_verified', 'cleaning fee', 'host_response_time', 'host_response_rate', 'host_acceptance_rate' columns are dropped from the df. We are now ready to answer our business questions."

    "The above analysis shows that over 40% of the Airbnb hosts response to customers' message within an hour, followed by the category within a few hours which makes up around 35% of the data. From above figures, we can come to the conclusion that the majority of Airbnb hosts tend to reply to customer messages within a couple of hours. This could be a useful reference for new hosts to determine their response schedule."

    "To determine factors that may influence the rating score of a listing, linear regression model is used as the dependent variable 'review_scores_rating' is a continous variable. We used linear regression function from both statsmodel and sklearn packages as they provide us different informations. Coefficients from both methods are compared and determined to be the same. P-value from statsmodel is then used to determine whether the effect of our predictors are statistically significant. Lastly, r-squared score for both train and test dataset and root mean squred error are calculated for model performance evaluation."

    "Firstly, let's have a look at our model results. From p-value column, we can deduce that cleaning fee, host response rate and host acceptance rate have no significant effect over the review rating score of a listing at significance level p=0.05. For categorical variable 'cancellation policy', only the effect of subcategory 'super_strict_30' is statistically significant. Moreover, whether a host is superhost also have meaningful impact on review rating score of a listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's focus on our predictors whose impact is statistically significant and explore more. From the coefficient column and the colored bar, we can see that the whether a host is superhost shows strongest effect on review rating score over other factors. A superhost on average has the a higher rating score by 5.68 units than those who are not. The second strongest predictor is the subcategory 'super_strict_30' for cancellation policy. For listings that has super strict cancellation policy, the review rating score is 3.28 unit lower on average compared to a flexible cancellation policy. Lastly, our third strongest predictor is whether the identity of the host has been verified. For listings that host identity has been verified, the review rating score is on average 1.28 unit higher than those host identity not verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have the anwser to our business question 2. The top three factors affecting review rating score of a listing are: whether the host is a superhost, cancellation policy of the listing and whether the host identity has been verified."

    "The adjusted r-sqaured score of 0.058 suggests that our model has explained only 5.8% of the variance in review rating score, far from ideal. Comparing adjusted r2 and r2 for training set, we could discover that adjusted r2 is slightly smaller than normal r2. This is because adjusted r2 takes model complexity into account and punished the model if a independent variable does not improve the model. As for the comparison of model performance on training set and testing set, the r2 score for testset is about 0.02 smaller than the r2 score for trainset. This implies that the model performs slighly worse on testset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, let's look at the root mean squared error. Our model has a root mean squared error of 9.28. This suggests that The average of squared differences between the predicted rating score and actual rating score is 9.28 units. As a smaller root mean squared error is desired, our model still has room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, our linear model performs relatively similar between training set and testing set. However, the model is far from ideal and requires improvement. The small adjusted r2 score suggested other independ variable could be added to explain more variance in review rating score. Moreover, a PCA could be implemented on all aspect of the reivew_score(value, rating and so on) and create a aggregated review_score dependent variable."

    "To answer business question 3, sentiment analysis is performed on the comments column in the review dataset. For any text analysis, the first step is text pre-processing. Letters are transformed to lower cases, punctuation and special characters removed. Texts are not tockenized into words with pos tags attached for each word. Pos tag helps identifying if a word is noun, verb, adjective etc. Words that are not English and common English stopwords are then removed. The last step of pre-processing is lemmatisation. \n",

    "Now, we have a clean text, sentiment analysis can be applied. As our review dataset does not contain a sentiment label column, we used an unsupervised lexical approach. Vader(Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon is adopted as it is specifically tunned for social media comments and views. After sentiment analysis is performed, we obtained a column of sentiment scores. Sentimen labels are then created based on the score. \n",

    "From the bar plot on comment sentiment, we can deduce that the majority (over 87%) of the comments are actually neutral. Only a tiny percentage of comments are classified to have negative sentiment. However, we can also see that gaining a positive sentiment is not easy for hosts as only roughly around 12% of the customer comments are positive. This echos with some voices from the hosts that they feel like maintaining and improving relationship with customer is also part of their job. They need to be proactive, explaining the rules of Airbnb and help customers to understand how the rating and superhost scheme works."

    "To conclude, in this project, we analysed data in Boston Airbnb listing and review dataset. From this project, we understand that most host tend to actively responding their customers, typically within an hour. The three top factors that determines the review rating score are whether a host is a superhost, whether the host identity has been verified and if the cancellation policy is super strict. The vast majority of customer comments is neutral and only a really tiny amount of comments are negative, suggesting a good commenting environment.\n",

    "Thinking about the future, the linear model could be improved in various ways. As for the sentiment analysis, the sentimen score and label computed could be further used in regression analysis to understand what elemnts could potentially lead to a positive or negative comment. This could help hosts to understand better how they could gain more positive comments."

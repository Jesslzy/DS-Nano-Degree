## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 

## Project Motivation
I undertook the Data Science Nano Degree at Udacity as I am interested in data science and would like to develop and improve my related technical skills. This repository is the main branch for all DS Nano Degree related projects notebooks and data. Files in this repository will be updated as the course progresses.

## File Descriptions
There are 4 main folders in this repository: data, notebooks, pythonfiles and utils. Data folder contains all the data used in project notebooks. Notebook folder stores all project jupyter notebook files. Pythonfiles folder contains python files for all projects where applicable. Utils folder contains sample functions in .py files and is for personal use and storage only.

## Results
Depending on the nature of the project, the main findings of the code will be published to medium as blogs where appropriate. The blog for the first project can be found [here](https://medium.com/@jessicalzy/want-to-be-an-airbnb-host-how-does-some-top-tips-sound-70357923ee87).

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
For the first project, credit must give to Airbnb for the data. The Licensing for the data and other descriptive information used in the first project can be found at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like! This section will be updated as the course progresses.
